  - JavaScript Regex reference: [`test()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/test), [`exec()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/exec)
  - String: [`match()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/match)
  - Splitting with regex: [`split()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split)
  - Replace with regex: [`replace()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace)

## Assignment

Design an exercise around regular expressions and/or an nlp library (like RiTa or Compromise). Here are some ideas if you are feeling stuck! (To be clear, just do **one** thing, and writing code is not required for this assignment!)

### Regular Expressions
* Experiment with using Regular Expressions in a text editor. What new powers does this unlock in your workflow? Write up a post documenting your experiments.
* Play an online Regular Expressions game. Write up a post documenting your experience.
  * [Regex Golf](https://alf.nu/RegexGolf) 
  * [Regular Expression Crossword](https://regexcrossword.com/)

### Regular Expressions in JavaScript
* Chop up a text into words using `split()` and rebuild the text as separate `<span>` elements that you can interact with individually.  [Here is example code](https://editor.p5js.org/codingtrain/sketches/Jr3zCQw-9) from [this video](https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/038-work-interactor.html).
* Create a programmatic version of the algorithm you invented in class and/or for week 1 homework.
* The [Flesch Index]() is a "reading level" score for a passage in English. Here is a [p5 example to calculate the Flesch Index](https://editor.p5js.org/a2zitp/sketches/OQx3A3Sa0) for text. How could this be improved / changed with regular expressions? 
* Create a mad libs generator.
* Create a "word replacer" (all words that start with E to words that start with A, all fruits with vegetables, etc.)

### RiTa
Investigate [RitaJS](https://github.com/dhowe/RiTaJS) and [Compromise](https://github.com/spencermountain/compromise) to see what kinds of metadata you can glean from a string.  [Here are a few examples](https://editor.p5js.org/a2zitp/collections/oG3L-OLvGP) to get you started.

## Data Source / APIs?
In preparation for next week, add a link to an API or some data source (even just data that appears in raw form on a web page) that interests you. I'll use this list to prepare examples for next week.
