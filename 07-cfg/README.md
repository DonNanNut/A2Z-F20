## Assignment

It is not required to write any new code for this assignment. You are welcome to run one or more of the provided examples with your own data. You can document the results in a blog post (or link to a web page where the text is generated). I'll include some other ideas below in case you are feeling ambitious.

### Context-Free Grammar

Invent your own grammar and generate text. Feel free to use [Tracery](http://tracery.io/) or even try Allison Parrish's new [Seaduck](https://github.com/aparrish/seaduck). [Here are several p5.js examples](https://editor.p5js.org/a2zitp/collections/5IFiJuQZa).

Getting results from a context-free-grammar can be tricky. Short and sweet, highly structured ideas tend to work well. For example.

- A coffee drink order generator.
- An apology generator.
- An ITP project idea generator.
- A knock knock joke generator.
