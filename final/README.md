# Final Projects

Your final project is a three-ish week assignment to be completed in two stages (proposal and implementation). Proposals will be presented in class on November 24 - [proposal presentation schedule and guidlines](proposals.md)!

The final project should be a creative project that builds off or is inspired by the concepts we've covered this semester. You should feel free to think non-traditionally, projects do not need to be screen-based and there is no requirement to use a particular aspect of JavaScript or programming.

Final projects can be collaborations with anyone in any class. Final projects can be one part of a larger project integrated with a different class.

Other notes:

1. Keeping things simple and small in scope is a plus. If your project idea is a big one, consider documenting the larger idea but implementing just a small piece of it.
2. Also think about making a final project for a small audience, even one single person like a family member or friend. . . or yourself. This can be a good way to focus your idea and design process. "Generalizing" the idea can come later (or maybe not at all.)

## Project Development and Testing

The testing will happen asynchronously in Discord. By Tuesday, Dec 1, each student should pin a link to your "work-in-progress" in your assigned channel. While having a functioning prototype is a great goal, you should also feel free to post images / video documentation, sketches for feedback. It's up to you to design your testing and feedback in the way that is most helpful for your project. This can mean something different for different projects. For an interactive web application, a link to a rough prototype is ideal. For a physical installation or performance or twitter bot, you might need to get creative. If you are not sure how to design your testing, e-mail me and we'll discuss.

Every student should test at least 3 other projects. You'll be tagged your assignments in Discord, but you should feel free to bounce around and check out everyone's work!
